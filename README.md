# Global Flood Mapper (GFM) - Version 2
This repository contains the source code and the link to the GFM portal as described in the article <em><strong>Global Flood Mapper v2: Flood Impact Assessment Using Sentinel-1 SAR on Google Earth Engine</strong></em>. This version is a direct successor to GFM - Version 1 described in the article <em><strong>"Global Flood Mapper: a novel Google Earth Engine application for rapid flood mapping using Sentinel‑1 SAR"</strong></em>. If you use this tool for flood mapping or use the source code to implement in some other work, please cite both versions as listed in the [suggested citation](#suggested-citation) section below.<br/>

Please read the usage instructions here [[link]](/instructions). Details of the tool can be found in the journal article (read full text here [[link]](https://rdcu.be/cP7Od)). Few examples of flood events around the globe can be found here [[link]](/examples).<br/>

## Access GFM here - [TBD]
The GFM allows the user to quickly create high-precision flood maps by simply selecting the area of interest from the dropwown menu and selecting the dates for before and during floods. The flood map can be directly downloaded from the GFM either in PNG or KML format. The advanced options in the GFM enable the user to tweak parameters that influence the flood map. For instance, choosing between ascending/descending pass, the threshold for Z-value for VV and VH bands, water seasonality threshold, and the elevation and slope mask threshold.

## Add GFM repository to your GEE scripts
You can add the GFM code repository directly to your GEE scripts using this link : [TBD].
