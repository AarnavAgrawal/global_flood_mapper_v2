## Source code of Global Flood Mapper

The source code of GFM can be found in this directory but we highly recommend you add GFM's GEE repository to your scripts to get access to the most recent version and to export flood maps at higher resolution directly via GEE code editor. Use the link below to add GFM to your GEE scripts:<br/>

Feel free to tweak parameters in the script as per your need or repurpose it to build your own app. But make sure to cite us--keeps the open-source spirit alive :)
